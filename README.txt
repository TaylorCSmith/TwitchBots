INTRODUCTION

So far I only have the basic format for a bot. It is meant to be used as a frame for an individual with instructions within the js file on how to connect to your chat using the bot. I did not include mine in there because it requires an Auth Token for you unique account. 

As I explore the bots uses more, if I ever start streaming, or if I get requests from streamers for me to make them a bot, I'll update this folder with additional bots (excluding authorization tokens and usernames).

If you have any questions, feel free to message me on twitch or discord.
